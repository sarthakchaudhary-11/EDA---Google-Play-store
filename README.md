Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

This repository contains comprehensive resources, code, and documentation for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline, involving techniques to summarize, visualize, and uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in data.

Features:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and data transformation.
Descriptive Statistics: Generating summary statistics for numerical and categorical features.
Visualization: Interactive and static visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
Feature Engineering: Identifying correlations, distributions, and feature interactions.
Use Cases: Example EDA workflows for datasets in various domains, such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.
Tools and Libraries:
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Jupyter Notebooks for interactive exploration
Detailed documentation for reproducibility
